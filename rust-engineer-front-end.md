# Rust Front-End Engineer @ IDVerse

**Full time - Remote - Earth**

Join a strong team of passionate engineers and build a world-class platform to fight identity fraud at a global scale. 

## The Position

You will work in close collaboration with our SVP of Architecture, our engineering team, our design team, and our product team to:

- Write and re-write hardened, documented, and tested Rust web front-end applications
- Convert our Figma designs to code and markup
- Participate in building our UI Kits
- Define best practices and lay the foundation for an expanding Rust team

A fair chunk is green-field work (and no, it's not crypto-currency related ðŸ˜‰).
Our front-end applications are written in **Rust using Leptos** for the WASM, and Tailwind for CSS.
We prefer event-based architectures, cloud (AWS), and serverless. The good stuff.

## Needed qualifications

Whilst technical competence is critical, we place great emphasis on passion, communication and collaboration across the business.

- You have a very solid experience creating and maintaining web-based applications (in Rust or not) ;
- You can demonstrate having built non-trivial Rust projects, ideally web-based;
- You are very comfortable with CSS, ideally working with Tailwind ;
- You are very comfortable with JavaScript/TypeScript (SolidJS, even better);
- You have a very keen eye for slick user interfaces and a taste for the small details ;
- You are able to communicate clearly, both in writing and orally, and collaborate effectively with a remote team ;
- You understand that documentation is half the battle, and that untested code is broken code ;
- You know it takes time to build anything correctly, and you also know how to "get things done" when the situation calls for it ;
- You are autonomous, but also know it's better to ask than to guess. You are dependable, responsible, and committed. You care.

## Location and Time Zone

Our team is globally distributed and fully remote.

The higher concentration is based around the Australian / East Asia time zones. You will need to have at least 5 hours of _quality-time_ overlap with the Sydney/Au time zone (no "graveyard shift", we care a lot about your health and overall well-being).

## About us

IDVerse is a Sydney-based start-up that is a global pioneer in the development of digital identity verification technology. We've built everything from the ground up and have a broad range of blue-chip customers across banking, telecommunications, government and more. We've perfected the technology locally in Australia and New Zealand, and are quickly expanding into the northern hemisphere.

We're still a small team, and take pride in making it smart and inclusive.
The position is remote and the work week can be flexible.
Remuneration will be competitive and based on experience.

**We encourage people from all backgrounds and genders to apply to this position**. As an early member of the team, you will have a great impact on its future shape.
